# Data-Knights

## Overview

### Purpose
Project uses movie production data to predict whether a new movie is likely to win an Oscar. Two relevant data sets are joined to create our table, then pre-process the data for supervised machine learning. Findings will be presented in a dashboard in Tableau.

### Content Outline

Topic: Movie Productions

Question to answer: To predict whether or not a new movie is likely to win an Oscar.
